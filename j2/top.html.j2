<h1>BNL Cold Electronics Testing Result Summaries</h1>

Here you can find a sumary (of summaries) of the BNL cold electronics
testing results.  These pages should be incrementally refreshed on an
hourly basis as new testing data is acquired.
This page was generated on {{ date_generated }}.

<h2>Summary Categories</h2>

The summaries are organized into different test categories which
define the general test station makeup.
These links are also available from the header of each page.

<ul>
  <li><a href="adcasic"><b>ADC ASIC</b></a> tests the ADC ASICs directly.</li>
  <li><a href="feasic"><b>FE ASIC</b></a> tests the FE ASICs directly.</li>
  <li><a href="femb"><b>FEMB</b></a> tests both FE and ADC asics together on an FEMB.</li>  
</ul>

Some different views of these basic result summaries are collated:

<ul>
  <li><a href="adcid"><b>ADC ID</b></a> collects all tests for a particular ADC ASIC as indicated by its ADC ASIC ID number.  Includes links to all associated ADC ASIC and FEMB test result summaries.</li>

  <li><a href="feid"><b>FE ID</b></a> collects all tests for a particular FE ASIC as indicated by its FE ASIC ID number.  Includes links to all associated FE ASIC and FEMB test result summaries.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Testing Rate</h2>

The rate of each type of test performed is summarized on a per day basis:

<ul>
  <li><a href="adcasic/testing-rate.html"><b>ADC ASIC dailies</b></a>
  <li><a href="feasic/testing-rate.html"><b>FE ASIC dailies</b></a>
  <li><a href="femb/testing-rate.html"><b>FEMB dailies</b></a>
</ul>

<h2>ADC ASIC Test Board Info</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="adcboard/usage.html"><b>ADC Board Usage</b></a> plot broken down by board ID and version</li>

  <li><a href="adcboard"><b>ADC Board directory</b></a> collects all ADC ASIC  test result summaries performed on a ADC particular test board as indicated by its board ID and a revision number that counts socket replacements.</li>

</ul>
